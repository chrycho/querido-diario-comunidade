# Collaborating

*Keep in mind that this project has a 
[Code of Conduct for Collaboration](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 
By participating in this project, you agree to adhere to the terms specified in it.

## How to collaborate

The Querido Di√°rio has several code repositories, and you can collaborate with any of them, including this one, which has more general documentation of the project.

If you have never contributed to an open-source project or are not familiar with this project, there are tasks for people like you in the *Issues tab*. They are labeled *good first issues*. If something interests you, before starting, you can leave comments to clarify any relevant questions or leave a notice that you will be working on that task.

We also have a [discussion forum](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/querido-diario-comunidade/discussions)
where you can contribute ideas related to the project. We have a community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nDc9p4drm4), and if you want to get questions answered faster or talk to people interested in Open Knowledge Brasil's civic innovation projects.

## Guide for maintainers

This section is dedicated to maintainers as code review and repository organization are part of the collaboration process. All code review guides are of public interest to everyone in the community.

### Responsibility of a person who maintains the Dear Diary:

* Respect the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and ensure that people have a safe and harassment-free environment. And that any victim of a breach of the code of conduct has a help channel;
* Always justify a suggestion according to the practices already adopted in the project, readability, and simplicity. A civic project must have as simple a structure as possible for beginners;
* The project must be tested before a *Pull Request* is merged;
* If a *Pull Request* has many commits and the messages are unclear, use the *Squash and Merge* option when merging. If the version history management discipline is good, this is not necessary.
